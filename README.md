## React - CRUD controlling dashboard

### Description

This is my solution to a take-home CodeSubmit CRUD assignment with a 6 hour time limit.
It features a finished app with Cypress tests.

### Tasks

* Build out the project to the designs inside the /wireframes folder
* Connect your application to the controlling API (_Note: Adding new items is only done in the client for prototyping reasons by now_)
* Implementation details:
  * parse the API response and display the results
  * add a form which makes it possible to add new items including an automatic calculation of the gross amount (feel free to use the currency you want)
  * build a overview box which represents the current state in the client
  * add a possibility for starring and deleting items
  * add a toggle button to just display the starred items
